# Challenge-3-JSRandompasswordGen
## This challenge features a random password generator that was to be finished in JavaScript applied knowledge from the bootcamp. While I am still not 100% confident in my Javascript abilites, this assignment got me one step closer to that goal. The problem this web app solves is simple. Many people get hacked or have their identity stolen because of data leaks or one of their accounts gets hacked and a reason for this is because they do not have a secure password and this app solves that issue. JavsScript is definitely still intimidating to me but little by little it is starting to click.

## Instructions for use are simple. Upon entering the web app you are met with a series of prompts and confirms and then a new secure password is generated in the box on the screen where the user can copy and paste their password into whatever the corresponding username will be.

## For this web abb I used various sources, mainly my mother-in-law who is a software engineer whose knowledge of app building is vast. I also used MDN Web Docs, W3 schools, and various Instagram and YouTube pages to guide me through this assignment.
